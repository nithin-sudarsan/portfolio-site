# My Journey at Perfios: Lessons from My First Job

## Joining Perfios: The Beginning of My Professional Journey

I started my full-time role at <a href="https://perfios.com" class="md-a">Perfios</a> Software Solutions in September 2023, fresh out of college. My initial month was dedicated to intensive training on core Java and data analysis. By mid-October, I joined the Insights team, where I familiarized myself with the extensive codebase through walkthrough videos. This phase helped me understand the intricate interactions between data analysis, server code, report generation, and UI components.

## Understanding the Development Lifecycle

Coming from an internship background focused on individual projects, I initially struggled with the structured release lifecycle at Perfios. Fortunately, the Insights team had excellent documentation, which helped me grasp the following workflow:

1. **Issue Creation** – CST creates an issue.
2. **Assignment & Scoping** – A senior developer assigns the issue, and developers estimate the effort required.
3. **Triage & Milestone Assignment** – Senior members review and prioritize issues.
4. **Development & Merge Request** – The developer completes the task and raises an MR for review.
5. **QA Testing & Release** – The QA team verifies the fix before releasing it to production.

Perfios followed a weekly release cycle, with major deployments occurring on the first three Tuesdays of each month. By March 2024, we successfully achieved an 8 PM release timeline by enforcing strict guidelines for MR submission and testing.

## Overcoming Initial Challenges: Scoping & Time Management

One of my biggest challenges was estimating issue complexity during scoping. Initially, I underestimated dependencies, leading to delays. One example was a salary transaction categorization task, where I failed to account for edge cases like salary debits due to excess payments. I learned that effective scoping requires foresight into potential complexities and cross-team collaboration.

To manage my workload better, I developed a **color-coded tracking system**:

- **Green** – Completed tasks
- **Yellow** – In-progress tasks
- **Red** – Terminated (on hold or infeasible)
- **Blue** – Scoped issues with effort estimates

This approach helped me prioritize tasks efficiently and meet deadlines.

## Key Technologies & Skills Acquired

Working at Perfios was a hands-on learning experience. Over nearly 1.5 years, I worked primarily on **bank statement analysis report customizations**, developing logic for extracting insights from financial data. The tech stack I worked on included:

- **R** for data analysis
- **Scala** for report generation
- **Java** for API development

I also gained practical experience with **Git version control**, learning commands like:

- `git rebase`, `git merge`, `git cherry-pick`
- `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git log`

Using Git daily reinforced its importance in managing large-scale projects and maintaining a clean code history.

## Cross-Team Collaboration & Client Customizations

I had the opportunity to customize reports and APIs for over **40 clients**, including **16 international clients** from Indonesia, Kenya, Singapore, the UAE, and more. This experience taught me how to:

- Efficiently communicate with **CST, QA, and PM teams**.
- Understand client requirements and **assess feasibility**.
- Optimize code for performance, considering large-scale data processing needs.

Working on performance improvements also helped me appreciate the importance of **writing efficient, vectorized code** to reduce turnaround time (TAT) and infrastructure costs.

## Mentoring & Leadership

As I gained experience, I had the privilege of mentoring new hires, guiding them through the **complex Insights codebase** and helping them troubleshoot issues. Since I had personally faced challenges when starting, I could anticipate their roadblocks and provide proactive solutions. This experience honed my communication skills and solidified my understanding of the product.

## Final Reflections

Perfios provided a fantastic work environment with **supportive managers and experienced mentors** who guided me throughout my journey. The experience helped me:

- Adapt to structured development cycles and **follow best practices**.
- Improve my **time management and issue-tracking skills**.
- Strengthen my **technical expertise in R, Scala, and Java**.
- Gain confidence in **cross-functional collaboration** and **client interactions**.

As I transition to my next opportunity, I carry forward these invaluable lessons and skills that have shaped me into a more competent and confident software developer.
