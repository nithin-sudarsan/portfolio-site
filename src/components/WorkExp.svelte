    <span class="title2">Engineering Journey</span>
    <p>
        I worked as a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://perfios.com" target="_blank" class = "link">Perfios</a> in Bangalore from <span class="highlight2 tooltip">September 2023 to April 2025<span class="tooltiptext">1 year, 7 months</span></span>, initially joining as an intern before transitioning to a full-time role.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Perfios, my role involved transforming complex business requirements into technical solutions that served over <span style="font-style: italic;">40</span> financial institutions, with a particular focus on international clients. We turned seemingly boring bank statements into goldmines of <span class="highlight tooltip">Insights<span class="tooltiptext">Fun fact: that's what our team is called, "Insights"</span></span> that power critical financial decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our work at Insights - <span style="font-style: italic;">turning ordinary bank statements into valuable financial intelligence</span> - accounted for nearly half of the company's revenue. While "bank statement analysis" rarely makes for exciting party conversation, there was something deeply satisfying about converting complex financial data into clear, actionable insights that power critical decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I had the opportunity to mentor new hires through code reviews and pair programming sessions, helping them navigate our complex data analysis codebase.
