    <span class="title2">Engineering Journey</span>
    <p>
        I currently work as a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://perfios.com" target="_blank" class = "highlight link">Perfios</a> in Bangalore, where I've been since September 2023, initially joining as an intern before transitioning to a full-time role.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Perfios, my role involves transforming complex business requirements into technical solutions that serve over <span style="font-style: italic;">40</span> financial institutions, with a particular focus on international clients. We turn seemingly boring bank statements into goldmines of <span class="highlight tooltip">Insights<span class="tooltiptext">Fun fact: that's what our team is called, "Insights"</span></span> that power critical financial decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our work at Insights - <span style="font-style: italic;">turning ordinary bank statements into valuable financial intelligence</span> - accounts for nearly half of the company's revenue. While "bank statement analysis" rarely makes for exciting party conversation, there's something deeply satisfying about converting complex financial data into clear, actionable insights that power critical decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I've had the opportunity to mentor new hires through code reviews and pair programming sessions, helping them navigate our complex data analysis codebase.
