    <p>
        As a software engineer at <a href="https://perfios.com" target="_blank" class = "highlight link">Perfios</a>, where I've been working for a little over a year, I'm basically a financial detective with a keyboard. My team and I turn boring bank statements into goldmines of <span class="highlight tooltip">Insights<span class="tooltiptext">Fun fact: that's what our team is called, "Insights"</span></span>, helping banks make smarter lending decisions. <br><br>
        Think of it as helping financial institutions swipe right or left on loan applications, but with more algorithms and fewer awkward matches. Sure, 'bank statement analysis' might not sound like a conversation starter at parties, but transforming complex data into powerful decision-making tools has its own kind of thrill â€“ plus, those streaming subscriptions aren't going to pay for themselves!
