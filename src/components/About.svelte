        I've had keen interest in technology since I was a kid, which led me to pursue computer science in high school and college. On this journey I discovered my passion for machine learning and deep learning.

    <p>
        Beyond tech, I write <a href="/blogs">blogs</a> about my AI explorations, travel whenever possible, and express my creativity through photography and graphic design. My professional and personal pursuits are guided by my curiosity and desire to create meaningful impact through technology.
